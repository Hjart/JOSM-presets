# JOSM-presets

These are specialized presets (used for speeding up tagging of objects in OSM) for JOSM (an advanced OSM editor)
They work better if you understand danish ;-)

"HjartsPresets" contains presets that I've developed over years for my own personal use.

"DanishChainsPresets" are intended to offer standardized names for shop chains commonly found in Denmark.
  it currently lists supermarkets and fuel stations.
